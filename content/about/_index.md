Hello! I'm a 4th year Computer Science and Statistics student from University of Waterloo. I have developed extensive interests in quantitative finance, data engineering and graph algorithms in my past internships and personal projects. Aside from work, I am also a hardcore metal guitarist, an avid community volunteer and a wannabe junior boxer. 

Feel free to reach me at jyang9788@gmail.com if you want to have a chat, or just have a cup of coffee to hang out!
