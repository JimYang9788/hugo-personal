Hello! I'm a 4th year Computer Science and Statistics student from University of Waterloo. I have developed extensive interests in quantitative finance, data engineering and graph algorithms in my past internships and personal projects. Aside from work, I am also a hardcore metal guitarist, an avid community volunteer and a wannabe junior boxer.

I am actively learning how to cook and how to paint (specifically water ink) in my spare time.  I am really enjoy cooking at the moment.
