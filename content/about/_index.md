Hello! I'm a 4th year Computer Science and Statistics student from University of Waterloo. I have interned at various software companies and finance companies in my past years of studying, and aside from work, I am also a hardcore metal guitarist, an avid community volunteer and a wannabe junior boxer.

I am actively learning how to cook and how to paint (specifically water ink) in my spare time. 

I keep a non-technical Booklist for 2020 (Please PM in the Contact tab if you have recommendations!):

* ~~The Plague~~  
* ~~Pride and Predjudice~~
* ~~To Live (活着)~~
* Dream of the Red Chamber 红楼梦 (It's taking me too long and is on my backlog now)
* Brother (兄弟）

Technical Booklist 2020
* Data Intensitive Applications 
* Elements of Programming Interview (Ay my interview preping)
* Option Volatility & Pricing By NatenBerg
* Hands on Machine Learning 

I am almost graduating, and I am planning on joining AISEC and travelling around the world after I graduate. 

Feel free to reach me at jyang9788@gmail.com
