Days spent in the Bay Area have been meaningful and lonely at the same time.

At the beginning of 2019, I decided to read more a lot more non-technical books. During my time studying at University of Waterloo, I found myself only reading tool books related to Finance and Computer Science. At one time, I really started to miss my second year in IB, where I read books like Ian McEvan’s Atonement, Rohinton Mistry’s A Fine Balance and Cormac McCarthy’s All The Pretty Horses. On one hand I was forced to read all these books, because I need to write commentaries; on the other hand, I was so in love the stories, and even til now I still remember some quotes. One of my favourite quote from A Fine Balance was:

“The secret of survival is to embrace changes…You have to maintain a fine balance between hope and despair. ” —-Rohinton Mistry, A Fine Balance

Thus I started reading again. I started off reading Haruki Murakami’s Kafka By The Sea and his most well known novel Norwegian Wood during my trip to Montreal and Quebec. After finishing reading them in January, I started reading Gabriel Garcia Marquez’s literature canon “One hundred years of solitude ” over the weekends when I am not doing any work. I found it painful to read it at the beginning, for several reasons: 1. Most characters share the same name(i.e. Arcadio, Aureliano, José). I had to (don’t laugh at me) write down the relationship/ family tree to keep track of these names 2. Gabriel’s mix of present tense and past tense. For instance,

“MANY YEARS LATER as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendía was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice.”
–Gabriel Garcia Marquez’s One hundred years of Solitude

Here he used “many years later”(present tense in narrative voice) , “was to remember” (future, he will remember), “that distant afternoon” (past tense, recalling what happened). I have to say this classical Marquez style quote is one hell of reasons that made this book amazing, but the side effect is that, sometimes I am so lost in figuring out what’s going on in the story.

I am looking forward to wrapping up reading this book.
