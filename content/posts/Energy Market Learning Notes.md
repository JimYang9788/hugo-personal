# Introduction 
Quoting from *Energy Finance and Economics* written by Betty Simkins, Russell Simkins,
"to understand energy finance and economics it is crucial to not only understand the 
dynamics of the energy industry, but also all sectors of the oil and gas industry".

Crude oil is made up of hydrocarbons that take shape in many sizes and forms. Methane, 
(remember the good old CH4 from highschool chemistry class?), made from one carbon atom 
and four hydrogen atoms, is the primary molecule in natural gas

## Terminology
**LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas)**: Natural gas that has been cooled down to liquid form
for ease of non-pressurized storage or transport 

**LNG Demand**: LNG Export + Liquefaction Demand (Feedgas)  

**Upstream**: describes the exploration and production sectors within the oil and natural
gas industry.  

**Midstream**: processing, storage, and transportation sectors within the industry and 
defines the processes that occur between the upstream and downstream sectors  

**Downstrean**: refining and marketing sectors of the industry
