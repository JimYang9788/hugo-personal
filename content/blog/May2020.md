It's finally May and I am glad that I made my way back to Waterloo. After spending 4 months (2 out of 4 months quarantined) in Calgary, I found myself desperately wanting to get back to home. I have almost never felt this way -- a mix of nostalgic and excited feeling.  

Time spent in Calgary has been precious. I learnt many new things: boxing (although that didn't end well as Covid-19 hits), 7 pull-ups in a roll (very random but I wasn't even able to do a complete one before),  Watercolor and onk painting (took some courses on Domestika and Udemy, but I still think it's better to find a personal teacher from OCAD when I back to Waterloo. Please PM me if you are interested!). I also filmed some proper guitar cover videos, including "Slow Dancing In a Burning Room" with Ray, "The beginning" by One Okay Rock, "Ice" by Ichika, "Blusey Wednesday" by Mateus Asato, "夏天的风" with JingJingYe.   

Here are the links to some of the videos that I shoot.
